# Title

Analysis of Tetris Ballistic Deposition and the Robustness of the KPZ Universality Class

# Abstract

The Central Limit Theorem's robustness invites an analogous question for the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this talk, we report some recent Monte Carlo simulations of Tetris-style ballistic deposition using 40 particle types (sticky/non-sticky tetrominoes in all orientations plus single-site pieces) sampled from configurable “jars”. This setup interpolates between random deposition (Gaussian, with $t^{1/2}$ growth rate) and ballistic deposition (KPZ, with $t^{1/3}$ growth rate). We want to see (i) how geometry and stickiness influence observed scaling, and (ii) whether mixtures exhibit crossover between Gaussian and KPZ behavior or a phase-transition phenomenon. Theoretical analysis is expected to be extremely challenging, so we rely on simulations in the hope of forming some key conjectures. A fundamental methodological issue---choosing a reliable time window to estimate the growth exponent from log–log slopes---will be highlighted, as it critically affects inferred universality. The project also yields an open simulation toolkit supporting teaching and student training in scientific computing, and outreach activities.
